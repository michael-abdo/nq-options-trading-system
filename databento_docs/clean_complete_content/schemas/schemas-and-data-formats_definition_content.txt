Market by order (MBO) provides every order book event across every price level, keyed by its order ID. This allows you to determine the queue position of each order and provides the highest level of granularity available.Market by price (MBP-10) provides every order book event across the top ten price levels, keyed by price. This includes every trade and changes to aggregate market depth, alongside total size and order count at the top ten price levels.Market by price (MBP-1) provides every order book event that updates the top price level, also known as the best bid and offer (BBO). This includes every trade and changes to book depth, alongside total size and order count at the BBO.Consolidated market by price (CMBP-1) provides every order book event that updates the top price level across all venues in the dataset, also known as the consolidated best bid and offer (CBBO). This includes every trade and changes to book depth, alongside total size and publisher attribution at the CBBO.BBO on trade (TBBO) provides every trade event alongside the BBO immediately before the effect of each trade. This is a subset of MBP-1.Consolidated BBO on trade (TCBBO) provides every trade event alongside the consolidated BBO immediately before the effect of each trade. This is a subset of CMBP-1.BBO on interval (BBO) provides the last best bid, best offer, and sale at 1-second or 1-minute intervals. This is a subset of MBP-1.Consolidated BBO on interval (CBBO) provides the consolidated last best bid, best offer, and sale at 1-second or 1-minute intervals. This is a subset of CMBP-1.Trades provides every trade event. This is a subset of MBO.Aggregate bars (OHLCV) provide open, high, low, and close prices and total volume aggregated from trades at 1-second, 1-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day intervals.Instrument definitions provide reference information about each instrument, which includes properties like symbol, instrument name, expiration date, listing date, tick size, and strike price.Imbalance provides auction imbalance data such as paired quantity, total quantity, and auction status.Statistics provides official summary statistics of each instrument that's published by the venue. This generally includes properties like daily volume, open interest, preliminary and final settlement prices, and official open, high, and low prices.Status provides updates about the trading session, such as halts, pauses, short-selling restrictions, auction start, and other matching engine statuses. The granularity and frequency of these updates vary by publisher and dataset.See alsoThe MBP-1, BBO and TBBO schemas, as well as the CMBP-1, CBBO, and TCBBO schemas, all provide top of book data with different update space and sampling intervals. Learn more about their differences in our MBP-1 vs. BBO vs. TBBO schemas guide.Why are Databento's naming conventions different from third parties?Databento avoids terms like Level 1 (L1) or Level 2 (L2) due to their inconsistent application. For example, some vendors refer to both MBO and MBP data as L2, while others strictly refer to MBP data as L2. More misleadingly, many vendors refer to MBO data as L3, even though this doesn't follow any major trading venue's naming convention.Likewise, the term tick originates from the concept of a ticker tape and only refers to trades, not resting limit orders. This becomes a source of confusion when vendors use the term tick data to refer to either MBO or MBP data when it should be strictly reserved for trades data.See alsoFor more Databento naming conventions and key terminology, visit our FAQs.Special casesOur MBO, MBP-1 and MBP-10 schemas adopt the following conventions in these special cases:
Combining MBO with trades feed: Typically, MBO data provides the highest granularity, but certain venues enhance their trades feed with additional information like trades not reflected in the MBO feed, consolidated NBBO, and more. In these cases, we document the exception in our Venues and datasets section and recommend that you request both our MBO and trades schemas if you need the highest level of granularity.
Deriving one schema from anotherDatabento captures market data directly from the source and is only subscribed to the most granular feed(s) available from each publisher. Order book feeds are usually normalized into our MBO schema and top-of-book feeds are usually normalized into our MBP-1 schema.To ensure consistency between schemas, Databento doesn't source the less granular schemas from separate feeds. Instead, Databento derives all of the less granular schemas starting from the most granular schema available. As you may have noticed from our schema's descriptions, the majority of them—MBP, BBO, TBBO, trades, and OHLCV—are simply derived from MBO data.Likewise, you can also derive one schema from another losslessly on the client side, and you should expect your self-derived data to be consistent with ours. For example:
MBP-1, BBO, and Trades can be derived from MBP-10.
BBO, TBBO, and Trades can be derived from MBP-1.
Trades and OHLCV can be derived from TBBO.
OHLCV can be derived from Trades.
Deriving your own schema is useful for various reasons:
The data needs to be defined differently for your application.
Our derivation differs from those of another vendor and you want transparency.
You can cut down the number of API requests made to Databento by getting the most granular schema that you need and deriving the rest yourself.
Databento provides MBP-10 merely as a convenience feature. You can reduce bandwidth requirements, latency, and transfer time significantly by deriving MBP-10 yourself from MBO.
This is especially relevant for OHLCV, which can vary depending on how trade breaks or market halts are managed, how the start and end of each time interval are determined, and how illiquid instruments are handled if there are no trades over a given time interval. If these considerations are trivial for your use case, Databento offers OHLCV data in multiple time intervals (seconds, minutes, hours, and daily) for your convenience.The table below summarizes which schemas can be derived from the another. Each row represents the original schema, and each column represents schemas that you can derive from the original schema.

Aggregate bars (OHLCV)Aggregate bars (OHLCV) provide open, high, low, and close prices and total volume aggregated from trades at 1-second, 1-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day intervals.Databento adopts the following convention for OHLCV:
The time interval is indicated by the schema ID's suffix: -1s for 1-second, -1m for 1-minute, -1h for 1-hour, and -1d for 1-day.
The ts_event timestamp marks the start of each interval.
If no trade occurs within the interval, no record is printed.

Other sampling intervalsIf you need other sampling intervals, we recommend that you construct OHLCV aggregates from trades data or subsample the OHLCV schema with the
nearest resolution on client side. For example, if you need 5-minute OHLCV aggregates, you can subsample this from ohlcv-1m.Best practicesIt's recommended that you construct OHLCV aggregates yourself from trades data if your application can handle the larger volume of data.
There will always be slight implementation differences in how a vendor constructs their OHLCV aggregates. These differences include how trade
conditions and retroactive trade breaks are handled, which timestamp is used for the event, and how precisely a vendor closes or publishes
the aggregate bar after the end of the interval. Daily OHLCV aggregates may also differ by whether best bid or offer prices are used to
compute the highs and lows, and whether the volumes should include block trades.Constructing OHLCV aggregates yourself ensures additional transparency into how the aggregates are computed and consistency within your
data.See alsoohlcv-1d is based entirely on prices and volumes from the electronic trading session and will be consistent with prices and volumes
observed from aggregating our trades data. However, this may differ from official settlement prices and volumes published by the venue,
which could include block trades, OTC transactions, and other effects. For official settlement data and more details about this, see
our statistics schema.Instrument definitionsInstrument definitions provide point-in-time reference information about each instrument, which includes properties like symbol, instrument name, expiration date, listing date, tick size, and strike price.Fields (definition)

Point-in-time instrument definitionsAn important distinction of Databento's instrument definition data is that we usually provide it in point-in-time format like the rest of our market data.In other words, the instrument definitions are timestamped to the nanosecond and treated as a time series, allowing you to simulate the sequence in which they arrived in real time. This is useful as it avoids lookahead and survivorship bias, and also allows you to backtest any strategy that trades instruments immediately as they become available intraday, such as new options strikes and new listings from IPOs.If you're switching to Databento from another data provider, you may find this behavior different, as many data providers only give you a cumulative list of all instruments or daily updates on instrument definitions.SnapshotsFor publishers that do not provide a full list of instrument definitions at least daily, the historical API provides a snapshot of all active definitions at UTC midnight Monday through Friday.
Therefore, any request for definitions for a 24-hour period beginning at UTC midnight is guaranteed to include definitions for all instruments active during that time period.Instrument definitions on time series endpoints vs. reference data endpointsDatabento also provides other forms of reference information and static data, such as corporate actions, cross-symbology mappings, and security master data. However, these additional forms of reference data may be found on API endpoints other than our time series endpoints.The reason that these are separated into different endpoints is that instrument definitions on our time series endpoints are those included with the primary source of data, which is usually a direct feed from a trading venue. On the other hand, other forms of reference data may originate from different secondary sources or need to be licensed separately from such direct feeds.Databento generally provides ways for you to join and merge instrument definitions and other forms of reference data.StrategiesOne definition record is created for each leg of a strategy or spread.
The primary fields will be the same for each of these records, while the fields beginning with leg_ will have information about the particular leg.ImbalanceImbalance provides auction imbalance data such as paired quantity, total quantity, and auction status.See alsoImbalance data normalization differs slightly from one venue or dataset to another.
Edge cases and differences are documented separately for each venue in the Venues and datasets section.Fields (imbalance)

Official vs. Databento summary statisticsThe key distinction of the statistics schema is these are official summary statistics provided by the venue—Databento doesn't compute these statistics.On most venues, Databento also provides separate OHLCV data that could be used in place of official open, high, low, and settlement prices, and volume from the statistics schema.These schemas are different and may vary for a few intentional reasons:
Often, official statistics have opaque methodology or are difficult to replicate because they're tallied by hand
Some venues include volumes and open interest from open outcry, auction, block trades, RFQs or other events that may not be disseminated in the electronic trading session or public feeds
Some venues double count volumes
The main purpose of Databento's summary data is that it provides more consistency: we derive it systematically from the tick data or full order book data during the electronic trading session and ensures consistency with our tick data; we publish at more deterministic times, and we normalize across venues using a UTC midnight cutoff universally. For electronic trading and research applications, this consistency may be more important, whereas for back office and administrative applications, official statistics may be preferable.StatusStatus provides updates about the trading session, such as halts, pauses, short-selling restrictions, auction start, and other matching engine statuses.
The granularity and frequency of these updates vary by publisher and dataset.Fields (status)
