SECURITY EXPOSURE AUDIT RESULTS
=================================
Date: 2025-06-13
Total tracked files in outputs/: 213
Total files with sensitive patterns: 42

SENSITIVE DATA BREAKDOWN:
- Databento API keys: 4 files
- Polygon API patterns: 9 files
- Tradovate credentials: 15 files
- Generic API/secret patterns: 11 files

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
1. 42 out of 213 files (19.7%) contain sensitive API/credential data
2. Multiple API providers affected (Databento, Polygon, Tradovate)
3. Various file types: auth tests, integration tests, config tests, analysis exports
4. Data exposure occurred when branch was pushed to public GitHub repository

ROOT CAUSE:
- .gitignore patterns were too specific and narrow
- Only excluded specific test patterns, not entire outputs/ directory
- Live trading test files fell through security gaps

IMMEDIATE ACTION TAKEN:
1. Created backup of all outputs/ files
2. Updated .gitignore to exclude entire outputs/ directory
3. Added !outputs_safe/ exception for legitimate examples
4. Verified .gitignore syntax works correctly

NEXT STEPS:
- Remove all tracked files from outputs/ using git rm --cached
- Create outputs_safe/ directory for sanitized examples
- Commit security fix
- Update scripts and documentation
