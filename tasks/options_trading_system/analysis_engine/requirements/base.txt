# Base Requirements - Core Dependencies Only
# These are the minimal requirements to run the analysis engine
# Install with: pip install -r requirements/base.txt

# Core Python - No external dependencies required!
# The analysis engine is designed to work with Python 3.8+ standard library only

# All analysis modules use only Python built-ins:
# - json (data serialization)
# - sqlite3 (database operations)
# - datetime (time handling)
# - threading (concurrent operations)
# - logging (system logs)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - enum (type definitions)
# - collections (data containers)
# - statistics (basic calculations)
# - pathlib (file operations)

# Optional dependencies are listed in phase4.txt for enhanced features
