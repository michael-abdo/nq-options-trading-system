# Phase 4 Optional Dependencies
# These enhance functionality but are not required - the system has fallbacks
# Install with: pip install -r requirements/phase4.txt

# Data Analysis & Manipulation
pandas>=1.3.0          # DataFrame operations for data analysis
numpy>=1.20.0          # Numerical computations

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.4.0      # Charts and dashboards for budget/performance monitoring

# Scientific Computing
scipy>=1.7.0           # Statistical significance testing for A/B tests

# Machine Learning (for adaptive thresholds)
scikit-learn>=0.24.0   # ML optimization for adaptive threshold manager

# Timezone handling
pytz>=2021.1           # Timezone conversions for market hours

# Note: All these dependencies are optional. The system includes fallback
# implementations that work without them, though with reduced functionality:
# - pandas: Falls back to basic dict/list operations
# - matplotlib: Disables visual dashboards, logs data instead
# - scipy: Uses basic statistical calculations
# - scikit-learn: Uses rule-based threshold adjustments
