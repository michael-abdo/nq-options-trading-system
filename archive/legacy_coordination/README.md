# Legacy Coordination Files

These files were part of the task-based implementation system with evidence tracking and hierarchical validation.

## Files Archived

- `global_status.json` - Global system status tracking
- `hierarchy.json` - Task hierarchy and dependency definitions

## Historical Context

These coordination files were used in the original task-based implementation where:
- Each task generated evidence.json files for validation
- Global status tracked completion across all tasks
- Hierarchical validation ensured parent tasks validated after children

## Replacement

The new Hierarchical Pipeline Analysis Framework uses:
- Configuration-driven pipeline execution
- Sequential analysis with enrichment/filtering
- Simpler orchestration without complex task dependencies
- Direct result validation instead of evidence-based validation

## Archive Date

These files were archived during the transition to the pipeline framework.
