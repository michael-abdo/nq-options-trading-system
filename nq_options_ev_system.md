# NQ Options Live Data Extraction System

## Updated Success Criteria (2025-06-02)

### PRIMARY GOAL
Extract **LIVE authenticated options data** from Barchart's NQ futures options page that matches the data visible in manual browser sessions.

### SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

#### 1. Data Quality Requirements
- **LIVE market data** (not delayed/stale)
- **Real bid/ask spreads** (e.g., 32.00/33.00, not "N/A")
- **Actual volume numbers** (e.g., 213, 175, 2037, not "N/A") 
- **Real open interest** (e.g., 40, 19, 217, not "N/A")
- **Complete OHLC data** with realistic prices
- **All standard options columns**: Strike, Open, High, Low, Last, Change, Bid, Ask, Volume, Open Int, Premium, Last Trade

#### 2. Strike Range Requirements
- Focus on **liquid at-the-money strikes** (21,400-21,600 range)
- Capture **both calls and puts** in the money-around range
- Minimum **20+ strikes** in the core trading range
- Must match the strikes visible in manual browser screenshots

#### 3. Data Source Requirements
- **Authenticated API endpoint** (not public delayed feed)
- **Same data source** that populates manual browser sessions
- Must include proper **authentication headers/cookies**
- **Live streaming data** that updates in real-time

### CURRENT STATUS

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Built closed feedback loop system with AI analysis
- Discovered page uses AJAX API calls for data loading
- Identified public delayed API endpoint (insufficient for our needs)
- Confirmed manual browser shows complete live data

#### ‚ùå FAILED APPROACHES
- **Public API endpoint**: `https://www.barchart.com/proxies/core-api/v1/quotes/get?symbol=MC6M25&list=futures.options...`
  - Returns delayed data with all "N/A" bid/ask/volume/OI
  - Wide strike range (14,000-24,500) instead of liquid focus
  - Does not match manual browser data quality

#### üéØ NEXT STEPS
1. **Capture authenticated session data** from manual browser login
2. **Monitor network requests** during manual browser session with authentication
3. **Extract live API endpoint** that requires subscription/authentication
4. **Reverse engineer authentication mechanism** (cookies, headers, tokens)
5. **Build production scraper** using authenticated endpoint

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

#### Required Data Format
```json
{
  "strike": "21,475.00C",
  "open": "32.00", 
  "high": "61.25",
  "low": "11.00", 
  "last": "25.00",
  "change": "-38.75",
  "bid": "N/A",     // Live: actual price
  "ask": "N/A",     // Live: actual price  
  "volume": "213",  // Live: actual volume
  "openInterest": "40", // Live: actual OI
  "premium": "500.00",
  "lastTrade": "14:54 ET"
}
```

#### Authentication Requirements
- **Barchart Premium subscription** likely required
- **Session cookies** from authenticated browser
- **API authentication headers** (tokens, keys)
- **User-agent and referrer headers** to match browser session

### SUCCESS CRITERIA CHECKLIST

- [ ] Extract data that exactly matches manual browser screenshots
- [ ] Capture live bid/ask prices (no "N/A" values)
- [ ] Capture real volume and open interest data
- [ ] Focus on liquid 21,400-21,600 strike range
- [ ] Include both calls and puts with complete data
- [ ] Maintain data quality that matches professional options platforms
- [ ] Build sustainable authenticated scraping mechanism

### FAILURE CRITERIA
- Any API endpoint returning mostly "N/A" values
- Data that doesn't match manual browser quality
- Focus on wide OTM strikes instead of liquid ATM range
- Delayed data instead of live market data
- Generic placeholder data instead of real market activity
