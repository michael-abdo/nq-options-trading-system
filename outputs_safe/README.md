# outputs_safe/ Directory

## Purpose
This directory contains **sanitized examples and templates** that are safe to track in git. Unlike the main `outputs/` directory, files here contain **no sensitive data** such as API keys, credentials, or real trading data.

## Directory Structure

### `chart_templates/`
Example chart outputs with sanitized data for:
- Documentation purposes
- Development templates
- Testing configurations
- Visual reference examples

### `sample_configs/`
Safe configuration examples with:
- Example API key placeholders
- Template configurations
- Default settings
- Development configs

### `documentation/`
Supporting documentation:
- Usage examples
- Configuration guides
- Security guidelines

## Security Guidelines

### ✅ SAFE to include:
- Example charts with mock/demo data
- Configuration templates with placeholders
- Documentation and guides
- Test results with sanitized data

### ❌ NEVER include:
- Real API keys or credentials
- Live trading data
- Production configurations
- Any file containing actual sensitive information

## Usage
Use files in this directory as templates and examples for development. Always verify that any new files added here contain no sensitive data before committing to git.
