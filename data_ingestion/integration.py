"""Data ingestion orchestration layer (IFD v3).

This placeholder provides a stable public function – `run_data_ingestion` –
that higher-level systems can call during development.  It currently performs
no network or file IO, but returns a shape-compatible success payload so that
tests concerned with end-to-end wiring can run without the full ingestion
stack.
