Key Features:
- Severity levels: INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL, EMERGENCY
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Alert history with retention policies
- Statistical reporting and analytics
- Convenience functions for common alert types

### 2. Security Monitoring System (`/tasks/options_trading_system/analysis_engine/monitoring/security_monitor.py`)
- **Authentication Monitoring**: Track failed/successful auth attempts
- **Data Access Auditing**: Log and analyze data access patterns
- **Intrusion Detection**: Pattern-based detection for common attacks
- **IP Blocking**: Automatic blocking for suspicious activity
- **Rate Limit Enforcement**: Monitor and alert on rate limit violations
- **Risk Scoring**: Intelligent risk assessment for security events

Security Features:
- SQL injection detection
- Path traversal detection
- Scanner behavior identification
- Suspicious user agent patterns
- After-hours access monitoring
- Bulk data export detection

### 3. Automated Reporting System (`/tasks/options_trading_system/analysis_engine/monitoring/reporting_system.py`)
- **Daily Operational Reports**: Comprehensive system performance summaries
- **Weekly Business Reports**: Executive-level metrics and trends
- **SLA Compliance Tracking**: Automated SLA monitoring and reporting
- **HTML Report Generation**: Professional formatted reports
- **Configurable Sections**: Customizable report content
- **Action Item Generation**: Automated follow-up task creation

Report Sections:
- Executive Summary
- Trading Performance
- System Health Metrics
- Cost Analysis
- Security Summary
- SLA Compliance
- Recommendations
- Action Items

### 4. Production Configuration (`/config/production/`)
- **Environment Templates**: Production-ready .env configuration
- **Comprehensive Config**: Full production deployment settings
- **External Monitoring**: DataDog, New Relic, Prometheus integration
- **Logging Configuration**: Multi-destination logging with aggregation
- **Security Settings**: SSL, authentication, rate limiting
- **Backup Configuration**: S3 and local backup destinations
- **Deployment Strategy**: Blue-green and canary deployment support

### 5. Enhanced Monitoring Dashboard (`/scripts/monitoring_dashboard.py`)
- **Alert System Integration**: Live display of active alerts
- **Security Metrics**: Real-time security score and events
- **Alert Statistics**: 24-hour alert trends and channel status
- **Improved Styling**: Better visual hierarchy and alert formatting

### 6. Configuration Files

#### Alert Configuration (`/config/alerting.json`)
- Channel configurations for all notification types
- Escalation chain definitions
- Rate limiting settings
- Alert threshold definitions
- Business hours and maintenance windows
- Auto-resolution patterns

## Key Integration Points

1. **Alert System ↔ Monitoring**: Production monitor automatically sends alerts on threshold breaches
2. **Security Monitor ↔ Alert System**: High-risk security events trigger immediate alerts
3. **Reporting System ↔ Alert System**: Reports can be delivered via alert channels
4. **Dashboard ↔ Alert System**: Real-time alert display with statistics

## Production Readiness

### Security Hardening
- API key masking in logs
- Sensitive data protection
- IP whitelisting support
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

### Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive logging to multiple destinations
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Automatic failover mechanisms
- Performance metrics collection
- Cost tracking and budget alerts

### Deployment Support
- Blue-green deployment configuration
- Canary rollout support
- Automated rollback on failures
- Health check validation
- Zero-downtime deployment

## Usage Examples

### Creating Alerts
```python
from tasks.options_trading_system.analysis_engine.monitoring.alert_system import AlertSystem

alert_system = AlertSystem()

# Create a critical alert
alert_system.create_alert(
    severity="CRITICAL",
    title="High Memory Usage",
    message="System memory at 95%, immediate action required",
    component="system_monitor",
    tags=["memory", "performance"]
)
```

### Security Monitoring
```python
from tasks.options_trading_system.analysis_engine.monitoring.security_monitor import SecurityMonitor

security_monitor = SecurityMonitor()

# Log authentication attempt
security_monitor.log_auth_attempt(
    success=False,
    source_ip="192.168.1.100",
    api_key="invalid_key",
    endpoint="/api/trading"
)
```

### Generating Reports
```python
from tasks.options_trading_system.analysis_engine.monitoring.reporting_system import ReportingSystem

reporting_system = ReportingSystem()

# Generate daily report
daily_report = reporting_system.generate_daily_report()

# Generate weekly report
weekly_report = reporting_system.generate_weekly_report()
```

## Next Steps

While Phase 3 is complete, the following enhancements could be considered:

1. **External Service Integration**
   - Complete DataDog/New Relic integration
   - Add Grafana dashboard templates
   - Implement CloudWatch metrics

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Machine learning for anomaly detection
   - Predictive alerting based on trends
   - Automated remediation actions

3. **Additional Channels**
   - Microsoft Teams integration
   - Telegram bot notifications
   - Mobile push notifications

## Conclusion

Phase 3 implementation provides a production-ready monitoring and alerting infrastructure that meets all requirements for operating the IFD v3.0 trading system at scale. The system is designed for reliability, security, and operational excellence with comprehensive alerting, monitoring, and reporting capabilities.
