# Live Streaming Fixes Summary

## Overview
Successfully fixed all three core disconnects that were causing issues with the NQ futures dashboard showing 15-minute delayed data instead of live streaming data.

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Time Disconnect (Futures Market Hours)
**Problem**: System was using stock market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET) instead of futures hours (Sunday 6 PM - Friday 5 PM ET)

**Solution**:
1. Added futures market hours functions to `utils/timezone_utils.py`:
   - `is_futures_market_hours()` - Check if futures markets are currently open
   - `get_futures_market_open_time()` - Get next/current market open time
   - `get_futures_market_close_time()` - Get next/current market close time
   - `get_last_futures_trading_session_end()` - Get end of last trading session

2. Updated `nq_5m_dash_app_ifd.py` to use futures market hours check
3. Updated `databento_5m_provider.py` to handle market hours correctly

### ✅ Phase 2: API Disconnect (Live WebSocket Authentication)
**Problem**: Live streaming failed with "CRAM authentication failed" even though historical API worked

**Solution**:
1. Enhanced live streaming authentication in `databento_5m_provider.py`:
   - Uses authenticated client's API key (self.client._key) first
   - Falls back to environment variable if needed
   - Added detailed logging for authentication flow

2. Added comprehensive error handling:
   - Specific detection of authentication errors
   - Clear error messages about permissions
   - Helpful guidance for users

### ✅ Phase 3: Evolution Disconnect (Scattered Fixes)
**Problem**: Multiple fixed versions existed (_fixed.py files) but weren't integrated

**Solution**:
1. Integrated all fixes into main `databento_5m_provider.py`:
   - Futures market hours handling
   - Smart data availability timing
   - Proper session end time calculation

2. Updated dashboards to use the unified provider
3. No longer need separate _fixed.py files

### ✅ Phase 4: Data Availability Timing
**Problem**: Requesting data at 13:54 UTC when only available to 13:50 UTC

**Solution**:
1. Implemented smart retry logic with exponential backoff:
   - Starts with 15-minute delay during market hours
   - Increases delay by 5 minutes per retry
   - Extracts available time from error messages

2. Added fallback mechanisms:
   - Cache lookup for recent data
   - Graceful degradation when API fails

## Test Results
All 11 comprehensive tests passing:
- ✅ Futures market hours tests (5/5)
- ✅ API authentication tests (2/2)
- ✅ Integration tests (2/2)
- ✅ End-to-end scenarios (2/2)

## Key Files Modified
1. `/utils/timezone_utils.py` - Added futures market hours functions
2. `/scripts/databento_5m_provider.py` - Integrated all fixes
3. `/scripts/nq_5m_dash_app_ifd.py` - Updated market hours check
4. `/tests/test_live_streaming_fixes.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Usage
```bash
# Start live dashboard (now works correctly)
./start_live_dashboard.sh

# Or run directly
python3 scripts/nq_5m_dash_app_ifd.py --symbol NQM5 --update 10
```

## Next Steps
1. Remove deprecated _fixed.py files (no longer needed)
2. Update documentation to reflect new functionality
3. Monitor live streaming performance in production

## Summary
The system now correctly:
- Recognizes futures market hours (Sunday 6 PM - Friday 5 PM ET)
- Authenticates live streaming with proper API key handling
- Handles data availability timing dynamically
- Shows appropriate messages when markets are closed vs data unavailable
- Works seamlessly for Monday morning trading (showing Sunday evening data)
