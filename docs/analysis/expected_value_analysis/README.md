# Expected Value Analysis (NQ Options EV Algorithm)

## Philosophy & Meaning

The **Expected Value Analysis** is the **primary trading algorithm** for NQ Options, designed to identify high-probability trading opportunities by calculating the mathematical expected value of potential trades using weighted market factors.

### Core Philosophy
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Every trade decision must be backed by positive expected value (+EV)
- **Multi-Factor Weighting**: Combines Open Interest, Volume, Put/Call Ratio, and Distance to create a comprehensive probability model
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Strict quality criteria ensure only the best setups are considered
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Incorporates risk/reward ratios to balance profit potential with downside protection

### Weighted Factors (Your Algorithm)
1. **Open Interest Factor (35%)** - Market commitment and liquidity depth
2. **Volume Factor (25%)** - Current market activity and conviction
3. **Put/Call Ratio Factor (25%)** - Sentiment and directional bias
4. **Distance Factor (15%)** - Proximity to current price for execution probability

### Quality Criteria
- **Minimum Expected Value**: 15 points
- **Minimum Probability**: 60%
- **Maximum Risk**: 150 points
- **Minimum Risk/Reward**: 1.0

## Trading Signals Generated
- **PRIMARY**: Best EV trade recommendations with entry, target, stop, and position sizing
- **QUALITY SETUPS**: List of all trades meeting minimum criteria
- **MARKET METRICS**: Overall EV landscape, probability distributions, and setup quality

## Integration Role
This analysis serves as the **PRIMARY ALGORITHM** in the analysis engine, with its recommendations taking priority over supplementary analyses (momentum, volatility, risk). All other analyses provide supporting context and confirmation signals.
