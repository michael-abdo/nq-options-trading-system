- [ ] **Staging Validation**: All tests pass in staging
- [ ] **Production Readiness**: All prerequisites met
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Monitoring and alerts configured

#### Staged Rollout Process
1. **Shadow Mode**: Run new code without affecting production
2. **Canary Deployment**: 10% of traffic to new version
3. **Limited Production**: 50% traffic split
4. **Full Production**: 100% new version with fallback

### 7. Monitoring & Evaluation

#### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: Latency, throughput, error rates
- [ ] **Business Metrics**: Success criteria tracking
- [ ] **System Health**: Resource usage, availability
- [ ] **Alert Configuration**: Automated alerts for issues

#### Post-Deployment Monitoring
```bash
# Check system health
python scripts/health_check.py --comprehensive

# Monitor performance metrics
python scripts/monitor_metrics.py --phase X

# Generate performance report
python scripts/generate_report.py --phase X --period 24h
```

### 8. Phase Completion
