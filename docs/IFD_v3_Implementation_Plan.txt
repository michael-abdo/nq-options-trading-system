      False positive filtering using market making flags
      Risk-adjusted confidence levels
  Phase 3: Integration and Testing (Week 4)

      Add IFD v3.0 as optional algorithm alongside v1.0
      Implement A/B testing capability
      Maintain backward compatibility with existing pipeline
    Enhance configuration system
      Add v3.0 specific thresholds and parameters

      System performance metrics
    Production rollout strategy
      Gradual transition from v1.0 to v3.0
      Real-time performance comparison
      Emergency rollback procedures
  Key Technical Requirements
    Databento MBO Schema Implementation
      Real-time WebSocket connection to GLBX.MDP3
      Parent symbol subscription (NQ.OPT) for all strikes
      Microsecond timestamp precision for coordination detection
    Bid/Ask Pressure Derivation Logic
      trade_price == ask_price → BUY initiation
      trade_price == bid_price → SELL initiation
      Aggregate by strike for pressure ratios
    Historical Baseline System
      Daily morning routine: fetch 20-day lookback data
      Cache statistical baselines (mean, std, percentiles)
      Incremental updates to avoid redundant API calls
    Market Making Pattern Recognition
      Simultaneous call/put activity detection
      Price decline coordination (volatility crush)
      Time window analysis (5-minute coordination windows)
  Cost Management Strategy
    Smart Data Usage
      One-time historical download: ~$20
      Daily streaming during market hours: $5-10/day
      Monthly budget target: $150-200
    Optimization Techniques
      Local caching of all processed metrics
      Stream only during market hours (9:30-4:00 ET)
      Use parent symbols to reduce individual strike requests
    Usage Monitoring
      Daily cost tracking dashboard
      Automatic alerts at 80% of monthly budget
      Emergency throttling at budget limits
  Risk Mitigation
    Technical Risks
      Stream disconnection → Automatic reconnection with backfill
      Data quality issues → Real-time validation checks
      API rate limits → Smart request batching and caching
    Financial Risks
      Cost overruns → Daily monitoring with automatic cutoffs
      Poor signal quality → A/B testing with v1.0 fallback
      Market condition changes → Adaptive threshold adjustment
    Operational Risks
      System failures → Comprehensive logging and alerting
      Configuration errors → Validation checks and staged rollouts
      Performance degradation → Real-time monitoring and optimization
