    - Confidence-weighted resolution (v3 gets 1.1x weight advantage)
    - Automatic logging to outputs/signal_conflicts/
    - Resolution types: V1_ONLY, V3_ONLY, V1_PREFERRED, V3_PREFERRED, MERGE_SIGNALS
```

### **Performance Caching Systems**
```python
class PressureMetricsCache:
    - 5-minute TTL for pressure metrics
    - Thread-safe with locking
    - Automatic expiration handling

class BaselineCalculationCache:
    - Pre-calculated daily baselines
    - 20-day aggregated statistics
    - Quick anomaly detection
```
