"""Integration layer for analysis engine (IFD v3).

This lightweight stub allows higher-level orchestration code (e.g. the
`tasks/options_trading_system` package) to import and call
`run_analysis_engine` without failing even while the full v3 algorithm is
still under active development.

The real implementation will:
    • Coordinate one or more analysis modules (institutional flow, expected
      value calculations, etc.).
    • Manage configuration schemas and validation.
    • Return detailed performance summaries and synthesis objects for
      downstream pipelines.

Until that work lands, this module provides a minimal, side-effect-free
placeholder so that integration tests, CLI tooling and documentation builds
do not error out on missing imports.
