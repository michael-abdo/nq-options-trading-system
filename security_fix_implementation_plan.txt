Security Fix Implementation Plan - API Key Exposure Prevention

Phase 1: Immediate Security Fix
  Emergency .gitignore Update
    Add complete outputs/ directory exclusion to .gitignore
    Add !outputs_safe/ exception for safe examples
    Verify .gitignore syntax is correct
  Repository Cleanup - Critical Security Step
    Create backup of current outputs/ directory locally
    Remove all tracked files from outputs/ using git rm --cached
    Verify no tracked files remain in outputs/ directory
    Test that outputs/ is now properly ignored
  Safe Examples Directory Creation
    Create outputs_safe/chart_templates directory
    Create outputs_safe/sample_configs directory
    Copy sanitized examples to outputs_safe/ (no API keys)
    Verify all examples are clean of sensitive data
  Initial Commit - Security Fix
    Stage .gitignore changes
    Stage new outputs_safe/ directory
    Create commit with clear security fix message
    Verify commit contains no sensitive data

Phase 2: Process Improvement
  Script Output Path Updates
    Audit all Python scripts for output paths
    Update scripts to use outputs/ for sensitive data
    Update scripts to use outputs_safe/ only for examples
    Test each modified script to ensure it works
  Environment Variable Validation
    Add API key validation before operations
    Add environment checks in sensitive scripts
    Create helper function for safe API key handling
    Test validation with both valid and invalid keys
  Documentation Updates
    Update README with new security guidelines
    Document outputs/ vs outputs_safe/ distinction
    Add section on API key best practices
    Update any references to old output file locations

Phase 3: Long-term Protection
  Pre-commit Hook Implementation
    Create git pre-commit hook script
    Add API key pattern detection (db-[A-Za-z0-9]+)
    Add other sensitive pattern detection
    Test hook with both clean and dirty commits
  Automated Security Scanning
    Create script for local repository scanning
    Add to installation test suite
    Schedule regular security audits
    Document scanning procedures for team
  Environment Isolation Setup
    Create separate dev/prod environment handling
    Document environment variable management
    Add environment-specific configuration
    Test isolation between environments

Verification and Testing
  Security Validation Checklist
    Verify git ls-files outputs/ returns 0 results
    Verify .gitignore contains outputs/ exclusion
    Scan all tracked files for API key patterns
    Verify safe examples available in outputs_safe/
    Test all scripts generate output to untracked locations
    Verify pre-commit hooks prevent future exposure
  Functionality Testing
    Test chart generation with new paths
    Test all configuration examples work
    Test API integration with new security measures
    Test installation script with new structure
  Team Communication
    Document all changes for team members
    Create migration guide for existing workflows
    Schedule team training on new security practices
    Establish ongoing security review process
