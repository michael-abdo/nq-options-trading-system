# IFD Dashboard Update Summary

## What Was Done

I've successfully applied the fixes from the working demo version to your live IFD dashboard. The key improvements include:

### 1. **Fixed Demo Mode for Weekends**
- Added `_create_demo_chart_with_data()` method that generates realistic sample data
- Demo signals now render properly when markets are closed
- No more white screen issues

### 2. **Simplified Callback Structure**
- Removed complex error handling that was causing rendering failures
- Added proper fallback to demo mode when no data is available
- Fixed timezone formatting issues

### 3. **Enhanced IFD Integration**
- IFD dropdown now properly loads configurations
- Signal overlays work with both live and demo data
- Proper error handling for missing IFD modules

## How to Use the Updated Dashboard

### Starting the Dashboard
```bash
# Option 1: Using the start script
bash scripts/start_live_ifd_dashboard.sh

# Option 2: Direct Python command
source venv/bin/activate

## What You'll See

When you open http://127.0.0.1:8050/:

4. **Chart**:

## Next Steps

1. Start the dashboard and verify it displays correctly
